## Widening Participation in Data Science and AI
Newcastle University, in collaboration with the Office for Students and Office for AI, is supporting a number of scholarships for <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/data-science-msc-pgdip-pgcert/">MSc Data Science</a> students for £10,000, that aim to target students often underrepresented in this industry, particularly focusing on female, black and registered disabled students. Other underrepresented categories include: students from POLAR Q1 and Q2, care leavers, estranged students, Gypsy/Roma/traveller students, refugees, children from military families, veterans and partners of military personnel. Students who successfully apply for a scholarship will receive £10,000 to help with the cost of course fees, living expenses and/or associated costs such as childcare and transport. To find out more please contact datascience@ncl.ac.uk.
